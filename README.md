# classification
classsify 2d data set by deep neural network

### classification_dataset.py
>functions which generate datasets. now has circle, moons

### network.py
>activation functions and network function which draw tensorflow layers by input dictionary.
>now it can draw fullyconnected, conv2D, transpose conv2D with reshape, batch nomalization. I'll update concat and residual.

### optim.py
>optimizer function which return tensorflow optimizer.

### classification.py
>you can input hyperparameters. e.g. batch_size, epoch, learning rate...
